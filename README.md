# Hi there, I'm Matias ðŸ‘‹

I have a bachelors of science in Biology. I am proficient in Java and Javascript and full stack web development with frameworks and libraries such as React and Spring.

Prior to pursuing a career in software engineering, I was involved in marine conservation. As a research assistant, I helped find ways to bring oysters back into New York City harbors. The humble oyster is the city's original engineer and it forms reefs which not only serve as nursery grounds for fish and other wildlife, but contribute to clean water and offer protection from storm surges.  Afterwards, I worked as a GIS technician for a non-profit organization, where I helped analyze data from aerial and underwater surveys to help protect critical marine habitat.

I decided to become a software engineer because I love to be creative, being able to build or maintain software that have a daily impact is very rewarding. And I love myself a good challenge as part of a team.  I'd love to hear from you if you're interested in collaborating on any projects!
